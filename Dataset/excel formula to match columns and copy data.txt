use match and index functions

first use match function to get the row number of the time in energy sheet that matches the time in weather sheet
=MATCH(A2,Sheet1!A:A,0)

then use that row number in index function to copy data of that row number from energy sheet to weather sheet
=INDEX(Sheet1!$A$1:$C$76842,M2,2)

use $ sign before each letter and number in the formula to avoid increment in the formula when you drag the formula to copy
